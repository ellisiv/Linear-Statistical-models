### Problem 1

**a)**
**1.**


The estimates are the entries of $\hat{\beta}$.  $\hat{\beta}$ is $$ \hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$$. Where $X$ is the desing matrix which contains observations for the covarites, and $Y$ i the response vector.  

The standard error is the sqare root of the variance of $\hat{\beta}$. Hence, $$\hat{SD}(\hat{\beta}) = Var(\hat{\beta}) = Var((X^TX)^{-1}X^TY) = (X^TX)^{-1}X^T Var(Y) ((X^TX)^{-1}X^T)^T = {\hat{\sigma}}^2 (X^TX)^{-1}(X^TX) (X^TX)^{-1} = {\hat{\sigma}}^2 (X^TX)^{-1} $$

**b)** A good model should explain the variance in the observations well, it should have small residuals, the residuals should be just random noise (that is normally distributed) and none of the covariates should be linearly dependent of the others.
